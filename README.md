# Elevate-TheGame

You're in this place with trees and a mountain.
There seems to be nobody here...
At the top of a mountain stands a rocket ship, but a strong wall blocks you from entering it.
Can you figure out how you will use resources, get to the rocket, and fly away?

## How to play
* WASD/Arrows to move, space to mine.
* E to view inventory and use the corresponding number to craft something.
* Use your resources to get to the top of the mountain and fly away in the rocket!
