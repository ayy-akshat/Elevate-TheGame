            Elevate is a game in which you spawn in a place with trees, grass, water, and more.<br/><br/>
            There's a mountain to your right, which has a rocket at the top in which you blast off to beat the game.<br/><br/>
            You break trees to make a wooden fist, which lets you break stronger material, such as stone, and make a stronger fist.<br/><br/>
            You keep upgrading your fist, gathering materials, and crafting.<br/><br/>
            Finally, you climb the mountain and blast off in the rocket.<br/><br/>
            Still confused about how to play? Don't worry; there's a tutorial in the game that covers it all.<br/><br/>
